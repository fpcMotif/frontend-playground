# Frontend Playground 🎨

A monorepo for frontend mini projects, experiments, and learning exercises.

## Structure

```
projects/
├── project-name/     # Each mini project lives here
└── ...
```

## Purpose

- Practice new frontend technologies and patterns
- Build small, focused projects without repo sprawl
- Keep all learning experiments organized in one place

## Getting Started

Each project is self-contained in its own folder under `projects/`. Navigate to any project and follow its individual README for setup instructions.
